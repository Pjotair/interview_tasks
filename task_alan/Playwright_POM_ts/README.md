You can install Node.js using apt. Open Terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Download the Windows Installer from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions.

### Using Node Version Manager (NVM):
You can also use NVM to manage Node.js versions. Follow the instructions on the NVM GitHub page to install NVM, and then use it to install Node.js.

## 2. Install Playwright
