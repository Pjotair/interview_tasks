# Interview Tasks

## Catalog `Playwright_POM_ts_alan_systems`
Inside the Playwright_POM_ts_alan_systems directory is a README.md file with instructions for setting up and running Playwright automated tests.

I created a Page Object Model and automated tests to solve the following tasks:
1. Write an automated test that will check all top bar menu options. Start from home page: 
<br> https://alan-systems.com/en/business/
<br> On each page check if the top bar menu (all options are visible) and footage (basic contact data) are displayed correctly.

2. Write an automated test that will validate required fields in job offer contact form. Start from home page: https://alan-systems.com  navigate to your job offer and validate if all fields are required.
